Sure! Here is a `README.md` file for the UTF-8 validation project:

# UTF-8 Validation Project

This project involves creating a Python function to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The validation is based on understanding the UTF-8 encoding rules and applying bitwise operations.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python Version**: 3.4.3
- **PEP 8**: Code must follow PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7.x)
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable

## Files

- `0-validate_utf8.py`: Contains the `validUTF8` function to validate UTF-8 encoding.
- `0-main.py`: Main file to test the `validUTF8` function.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Project Description

The project involves writing a function `validUTF8(data)` that determines if a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The dataset is represented by a list of integers, each representing one byte of data. The function should return `True` if the data is valid UTF-8 encoding, otherwise `False`.

### UTF-8 Encoding Rules

1. **1-byte character**: 0xxxxxxx (7 bits)
2. **2-byte character**: 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx (11 bits)
3. **3-byte character**: 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx (16 bits)
4. **4-byte character**: 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx (21 bits)

### Function Prototype

```python
def validUTF8(data):
    """
    Validate if a given list of integers represents valid UTF-8 encoding.
    
    Args:
    data: List of integers where each integer represents a byte of data
    
    Returns:
    True if the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else False
    """
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Initialization**: Start with `num_bytes` set to 0.
2. **Bit Masks**: Use `mask1` (10000000) and `mask2` (01000000) to check the leading bits.
3. **Iterate through Data**:
   - If `num_bytes` is 0, count the leading 1's in the current byte.
   - If the byte indicates it's a single byte character (leading bit is 0), continue.
   - If it's more than 4 bytes or just a single leading 1, return `False`.
4. **Subsequent Bytes Check**: Ensure subsequent bytes in a multi-byte character start with '10'.
5. **Final Check**: Ensure all bytes for characters are processed correctly by checking `num_bytes` is 0 at the end.

### Example Usage

To test the function, create a file `0-main.py` and include the following test cases:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Main file for testing
"""

validUTF8 = __import__('0-validate_utf8').validUTF8

data = [65]
print(validUTF8(data))  # Expected output: True

data = [80, 121, 116, 104, 111, 110, 32, 105, 115, 32, 99, 111, 111, 108, 33]
print(validUTF8(data))  # Expected output: True

data = [229, 65, 127, 256]
print(validUTF8(data))  # Expected output: False
```

### How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3.4.3 is installed on your Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Ensure the Python files are executable.
4. Run `0-main.py` to test the `validUTF8` function.

```bash
chmod +x 0-validate_utf8.py
chmod +x 0-main.py
./0-main.py
```
